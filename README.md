# react-native-circular-slider-example

My quick attempt at answering [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38253804/how-to-make-a-circular-slider-in-react-native).

Makes use of the wonderful [magicismight/react-native-svg](https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg) project to draw custom UI using declarative SVG instead of dropping into platform specific drawing code (win!).
